# Svg-logo-maker

## Description
The purpose of this file is to create a svg log generator where you can insert the shape that you want the color that you want the logo to be, alog witha few letter word on it that has a color of your choice. through out this project there was a lot that need to happen in order to achive the goal of having the svg created. First I needed to link npm packages that  would help take the readers input in from the terminal and turn it into a file that can be created with that information.With all the infomation that we learned in class I was able to figure out what we would need for the code but the real chal;lenge was to undersatnd what an svg was and how they are used.

## Installation

in order to to run this program there are a couple things that youll have to have installed. the first thing would be node and then then the next couple of things to download are the packages that are used in that package.jsons file

## Usage

for using this you'll need to open up your terminal and then download all the packages that you need to run the file. next youll need to run the index.js file and enter the input that appears on it, one its all done you can then have an svg generated for you.
